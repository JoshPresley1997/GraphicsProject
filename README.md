# GraphicsProject
final project for computer graphics class with Dr. Kent by Joshua Presley
104373941

# 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES
This project uses the following 3rd party libraries:
1. SDL2.0 - https://www.libsdl.org/
    Functions for ease of creating windows and interacting with openGL
2. GLEW - http://glew.sourceforge.net/
    GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform
3. GLM - https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
    OpenGL Mathematics library. Makes vectors and matrices easy work.
    
# USE OF THE PROJECT  
Please note that this project, once copied, should be left in debug mode. Full release mode features are not working at the moment.
To use this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Ensure that the solution is set for DEBUG mode and is targed for x86 archetecture.
4. Push f5 or the Run button in Visual studio
5. Move around the scene. Use the keys WASD for movement and the mouse to look around. 
6. Push the Escape key to exit. If you accidentally click out of the application, push ALT + TAB until it is back in focus.

# GOALS ATTEMPTED
I believe the project demonstrates the following criteria from the project outline:
1. 2D Objects
2. 3D Objects/Polyhedral
3. Hierarchical models
4. Scene modeling
5. Basic drawing of objects
6. Surface rendering
7. 2D Clipping 
8. 3D Clipping 
9. Concave, Windows with holes
10. Simple ambient lighting
11. Moving POV/camera(s)

A repo exists here for some of the work from the series. https://github.com/GEMISIS/Zombie-Slayer-Summit/tree/master/Zombie%20Slayer%20Summit/Zombie%20Slayer%20Summit/source/graphics
I used this series to learn and apply a many of the concepts I attempted. Mistakes were made by not attending the tutorials this semester.
